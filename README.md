# Hashing Algorithms And Coding up a File Integrity Monitor FIM (FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING)


<h2>Description</h2>
I am exploring hashing algorithms and learning about file integrity monitoring to better understand integrity in cybersecurity. As a hands-on project, I am coding a basic File Integrity Monitor. This is my first time coding, although I used ChatGPT to help identify errors I encountered, for instance the FIM kept looping false positives due to improper brackets. I'm excited to continue learning more about coding, particularly with Python, due to its versatility. As I develop my skills in cybersecurity, I'm eager to explore how coding can enhance my capabilities in this field.



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b>
- <b>Hashing Algorithm SHA512</b>
