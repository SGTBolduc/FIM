# Hashing Algorithms And Coding up a FIM (FILE INTEGRITY MONITOR)


<h2>Description</h2>
As part of my journey into cybersecurity, I am exploring hashing algorithms and learning about file integrity monitoring to understand the importance of data integrity. For a hands-on project, I am coding a basic File Integrity Monitor (FIM). This is my first experience with coding, and I have been using ChatGPT to help identify and resolve errors. For instance, I encountered an issue where the FIM kept generating false positives due to improper use of brackets.

<br />
I'm particularly excited about learning Python due to its versatility and wide range of applications in cybersecurity. As I continue to develop my coding skills, I'm eager to discover how programming can enhance my capabilities in identifying, monitoring, and mitigating security threats. This project has been a valuable introduction to practical cybersecurity concepts and the role of coding in building effective security tools..
